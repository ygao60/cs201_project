a java project of a chicken wing order system



This application is a chicken wings online order system. The chicken wings restaurant provide three kinds of options: set A, set B, set C. Each set has different price and contain different amount of chicken wings. The customers can order online and the chicken wings restaurant will deliver the food to the address and time assigned by the customer. A customer need to input how many of each set he want, his name and phone number, his address, and the day and time he want the food delivered to the address. The interface will ask whether the customer has E-coupon. The customer can enter the amount of E-coupon they have. The system will then show the total Price of the order. The restaurant can sort all the orders by the delivery time, from the earliest to the latest. The restaurant will only deliver if the order is equal to or above 50 dollars. The system will show that the order is not valid if the total price is below 50 dollars. The restaurant will sell no more than 1000 chicken wings each day. The customer can choose whether they want to make an order, cancel an order, confirm an order, see existing orders or see the number of chicken wings ordered on each day so that they will know whether there is enough chicken wings on the day they want it. The input data are the existing delivery orders.
